# Smart Contract Analysis
## Introduction
A large part of being a developer in Blockchain at Berkeley is adapting to new tools and frameworks effectively.

In this task, you'll be working with the source code of a basic smart contract written in **Solidity**. A compiled JS-like language specific to Ethereum's virtual machine. 

## The Problem
The task is two-fold:
  1. After reading through and understanding the smart contract's code, you will complete a write-up for the general idea of what the contract is supposed to do in addition to three different ways the smart contract ensures that it works as intended. Add your response to the file `response.md`.
  2. Find a way to deploy the contract to the live [Ropsten Ethereum testnet](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/13534/what-is-actually-ropsten-what-is-a-new-network). This task is intentionally lacking in instructions as you are expected to do research into how this is done; feel free to consult any online written or video guides. It is recommended that you use [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/) (a free online IDE) in tandem with [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) (a browser extension) to complete this task. You should be able to find your deployed smart contract on the blockchain explorer site [Etherscan](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/), add a link to it to the file `response.md`.
